        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="muted">Last updated: December 29, 2025</p>
      </div>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By using QuickPost (the “Service”), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>
        QuickPost allows you to connect third-party social accounts and publish content to them. Your use of any connected platform
        is also governed by that platform’s terms and policies.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be legally able to form a binding contract and meet the minimum age required by your local laws and the connected platforms.
      </p>

      <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for the content you publish.</li>
        <li>You must have rights/permissions to use the images, videos, captions, and links you post.</li>
        <li>You agree not to misuse the Service (spam, illegal content, policy violations, abuse, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Connected Platform Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        When you connect a platform account, you authorize QuickPost to access and act on your behalf within the permissions you grant
        (e.g., creating posts). You can revoke access by disconnecting the account in the Service or via the platform settings.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Service Availability</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time. We are not liable for platform API changes,
        outages, or permission restrictions imposed by third-party platforms.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee that publishing will always succeed because platform APIs
        may fail, change, or restrict access.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent allowed by law, QuickPost will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages
        arising from use of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or if required to comply with law or platform policies.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Contact</h2>
